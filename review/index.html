<h1>Manifest</h1>
    <img src="images/Manifest.jpg" alt="Manifest Show Poster">

<p style="text-align:center">Originally from NBC and finished by Netflix, Manifest follows the story of Flight 828 who took off in Jamaica, and landed in New York, 5-1/2 years laters. For years, the 191 passengers were presumed dead by their loved ones, until they came back without having aged a single day. For the passengers, they were only gone for a few hours, so it takes them time to adjust and comprehend 5-1/2 years have passed. As the passengers try to adjust to their new lives, they start seeing and hearing things in their heads, which they call <em>"Callings"</em>. As they follow their callings, they reveal many secrets, and they ultimately discover why they truly came back.</p>

<h2>Important Characters: The Stone Family</h2>
<p>Half of the Stone family was on Flight 828, the show focuses on Ben, Cal, and Michaela Stone. They are amongst the first ones to experience the first callings and are the most involved in solving the callings.</p>

<h3>Ben and Cal Stone</h3>
<P>Ben Stone and his 11-year old son, Cal, were on the flight. Although Call was the youngest on the plane, he is experiencing the callings much stronger than any other passenger. Ben, being a previous math professor, decided to keep tabs on all the passengers and makes it his life's purpose to help other passengers solve their callings.</P>
<h3>Michaela Stone</h3>
<p>Sister to Ben, Michaela was the first passenger to experience a calling. "Slow down....slower...<strong>SLOW DOWN!</strong>" was Michaela's first calling, and the first calling amongst the passengers. Through this calling, she heard an insistent voice in her head telling her that the bus driver needed to slow down. Michaela tried to get the bus driver to slow down, but he wouldn't. It wasn't until she screamed at him to stop the bus, that the driver made a sudden stop. At the same time as he stops, a kid runs after his ball into the street. If Michaela wouldn't have told the bus driver to stop, the kid would have been fatally hit by the bus. This was the first time a calling helped save the life of a person.</p>

<h2><em><ins>It's All Connected</ins></em></h2>
<p>One of the main reasons why I love this show so much is how well everything was written. The writers made sure that everything connects at the end. A big saying in the show is "It's all connected", which throughout the show we see a lot of examples of. The writers made sure to drop little cues in season 1 that don't connect or reveal their bigger purpose until season 4. Everything throughout the show is connected in one way or another.</p>
