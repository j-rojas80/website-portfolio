    <h3 style="text-align:center">Hobby #1:Reading</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center">One of my favorite ways to pass time is reading, to me, reading is a form of escapism. A book can take you anywhere in the world, and even to the past and future. My favortite book genre would have to be thriller books, I love the suspense that they provide.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Hobby #2: Netflix</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center">Similarly to reading, a good Netflix show can really keep you hooked. Netflix is my most used streaming app, and it has my favorite tv show, Manifest. Manifest is a show I would never get tired of re-watching,as a matter of fact I just started watching it for the 5th time. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center">Hobby #3: Nature</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">If I'm not inside watching Netflix or reading, then you'll probably find me outide admiring nature. All year round I like to spent some time outside. I really enjoy taking afternoon walks through my neighboorhood with my dog, Willy.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Why Web-105?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">The reason why I decided to take this class here at <a href=https://www.mchenry.edu/>McHenry County College</a> was, because I recently discovered I want to be a computer science major. I always enjoyed my math classes and knew I wanted to do something math-related, but had a hard time narrowing it down. It was until talking to a close family friend in the field and the computer science teacher at my high school that I discovered this is what I want to do. So this is me beginnig that computer science journey, and I'm glad to be here.</p>
